Introduction
============

Tomate2 is a simple productivity notification icon freely inspired from the
Pomodoro technique, forked from https://gitorious.org/tomate/tomate by Joël Schaerer.

The idea is as follows: when you start the timer, the icon becomes red.
Starting means you commit to working without interruption for at least 
ten minutes. 

After these ten minutes, the icon turns green, meaning that you are free to 
continue working or to take a break whenever you like.
After 25 minutes, you should take a break and it will notify you and then go to 
idle.

The rationale is that the hardest part of working is getting at it. Past the
first ten minutes, continuing to work is far easier. So you only have to commit
to the first ten minutes, your motivation should do the rest.

Running and installing
======================

To run the applet, simply launch tomate.py: ./tomate2.py.

You can also install it globably on your system using the provided install
script. The command to launch is then "tomate2" (without the .py).

To uninstall you can use the provided uninstall script.

If you like it, I would suggest adding it to the startup applications of your
desktop environment.
